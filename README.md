badger
======

Write or improve tests, get badges. Remove tests, get anti-badges.

Currently targeting mocha and git since that's what I use.

To see the (not very useful) output right now try `./repo-stats.js <path to a git
repo>`

Badges
------

- Wishful Thinking: Created a test file with nothing in it.
- Procrastination: Created a test file containing nothing but stubs.
- Planting the Seed: Created a test file containing exactly one test.
- ... fork and add your suggestions!

I'd really like it if the badges were well-aligned with good testing practices,
because if we set out to motivate people with badges they might actually
respond--and if they respond by doing something bad that might be worse than
just having bad test coverage.
